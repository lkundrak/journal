 KDE). The distro feels very polished, from the bootup procedure to the Desktop
 itself. They replaced the GNOME menu with their own version, and I'd say it
 could use some improvement (found it hard to launch terminal :). It does only offer
 a couple of most used applications, it uses a separate dialog to find
 and run some other application. You can't search for an application from the menu.
 Probably needless to add, this is just a matter of taste, not a technical barier.

 if they parallelized it (not that {{{yum}}} would do that).
