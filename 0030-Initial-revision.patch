+Calling themselves [http://www.widelife.sk/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1 Widelife CLUB],

+  table football, Fridays, our leader Tomas etc.

+is ok with [http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/reports/were-trashin-it
+devastation of rainforests], otherwise they may burn in [http://www.mindfully.org/Food/Hindus-Sue-McDonalds.htm
