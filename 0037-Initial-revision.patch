+[http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Editions VirtualBox OSE] 2.1.0 was released,
+bringing support for 64-bit guests. Apart from
+that, it adds a {{vmnet}}-style packet injection for unprivileged user via a
+dedicated kernel module and a whole handful of features to its closed source brother.
+
+So why would anyone use that? VirtualBox OSE brings a high-performance full
+virtualization to desktops of people whose hardware doesn't support
+[http://kvm.qumranet.com/kvmwiki KVM].
+Furthermore it equips them with a mature, stable, and easy to
+use user interface, who is in many areas still superior to {{{virt-manager}}}.
+In other words -- it saves them from ''VMWare'', replacing it with a lightweight
+and fast package which is hardly 20-th of size.

+
+It was undoubtly a very demanded package for many Fedora users, thogh its
+kernel modules of questionable quality prevented it from entering Fedora.
+Please note that the word ''questionable'' does not necessarily mean ''bad'',
+understand it as ''undecided'', since there was no attempt to merge it with
+mainline kernel and therefore comply with kernel quality standards.
+
+== Packages for RPM Fusion being reviewed ==
+
+Fedora does not permit kernel modules built outside of mainline tree, but
+[http://rpmfusion.org/ RPM Fusion] does. And finally it seems it will leave RPM
+Fusion's wishlist soonish: [//bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=285 A review]
+was already submitted and taken by Xavier (thanks to him)!
