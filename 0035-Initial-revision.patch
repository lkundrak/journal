+Packages of NCSA Mosaic patched to run on modern Linux desktop
+[http://v3.sk/~lkundrak/mosaic/ are available for download].

+
+They are patched so that they behave at least somehow sensible with
+today's sick web sites.
+
+Hope they'll run with lesstif. The license is bad enough not to
+permit it to go to Fedora (thanks God!). If you think this should
+go to RPM Fusion for some reason, feel free to grab the packages :)
