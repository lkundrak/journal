Dearest Fedora and Inkscape users,

As you may have noticed, Fedora 11 (Leonidas) will ship with SVN snapshot
of Inkscape that targets 0.47 release. As such it may have bugs that will
not be present in the release and even incomplete feature set since it is
from few days before the feature freeze.

This was done due to demand from user base and to help shape the final 0.47.

Once Inkscape 0.47 is released, which is
[http://www.inkscape.org/#The_road_to_0.47:April_21,_2009 planned for mid-July],
it will be pushed to the stable updates repository. Until then, testing
repository will be regularly updates with beta and release candidate packages
starting with a [https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/inkscape-0.47-0.9.20090518svn.fc11
snapshot from May 18th]. See Fedora Wiki for details on
[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Updates_Testing
how to get the package from the testing repository].

Any feedback is, of course welcome. Please report issues you'll find at
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape Inkscape's bug tracker] or
[http://bugzilla.redhat.com/ our Bugzilla instance]. Please ensure you're
running latest {{{inkscape}}} package from the testing repository
before reporting a bug.

Have fun with brand new Fedora and Inkscape!
