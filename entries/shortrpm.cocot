<!-- rss:description -->
Ever wonderred why can't you do a {{{rpmbuild -bb --short-circuit}}} just
after you found out that you forgot to add something in {{{%files}}}
or made a typo in {{%install}}, having waited three hours for a package
to compile? Being able to quickly fix your problem could easily save you
many hours of compiling.  You could check whether the package is able to install,
check whether dependencies are fine, the program runs, scriptlets behave fine
or just {{{rpmlint}}} the resulting package.

There are lot of packages that take >1 hour to build, and for certain
packages, say {{{java-1.6.0-openjdk}}} on PowerPC, an extra compilation
effectively means one more day to get the package done.

If you don't like having to rebuild your package every time you make a
small mistake just because of a [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=478463
religious issue with RPM] you may have a look at
{{{[https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packages/name/shortrpm shortrpm]}}}
package. It transparently wraps {{{rpmbuild}}}, causing it to think
most sections contain {{{exit 0}}} as first command intercepting {{{open}}}(3)
call via {{{LD_PRELOAD}}}.

== Workflow ==

Once you install the {{{shortrpm}}} package (and eventually restart your shell),
you may follow the same procedure when building the package as before,
while gainging the ability to short-circuit the binary package build:

  rpmbuild -ba gnomovision.spec

''Oh my! Install failed on EL-5 since I forgot to add {{{--vendor}}}
parameter to {{{desktop-file-install}}}.'' Fix it.

  rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit gnomovision.spec

''Succeeded. Fine.'' You'd have to do an extra rebuild here without {{{shortrpm}}}.

  rpmbuild -bb --short-circuit gnomovision.spec

''{{{rpmlint}}} says you're missing {{{%defattr}}} and that your permissions
are generally insane.'' Fix it. Again one more rebuild without {{{shortrpm}}}.

  rpmbuild -bb --short-circuit gnomovision.spec

''Looks fine.'' I'm gonna do a final build to ensure everything builds fine as it is.

  rpmbuild -ba gnomovision.spec
