The quickest way I've found for getting rid of crop marks before
printing out pages from [http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/ Linux Device Drivers]
(you would not believe how annoying they could be :)

  pstops -pa4 '0@1.3(-3.5cm,-4cm)' ch10.ps ch10-cropped.ps

I'm wondering whether there's a GUI tool that could save me from
trial-and-error while finding the right shift and scale.
