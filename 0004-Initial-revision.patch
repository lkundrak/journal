+<!-- rss:description -->
+Contrary to popular belief, IBM NetVista Thin Clients can run recent 2.6 kernels.
+Though it need some effort and, well binary blob bootstrap loader, it is possible.
+All the hardware they contain is fairly well supported and givent the belief
+mentioned, their reputation is fairly wrecked and they can be gotten for very good
+prices, which makes an ideal toy out of them, or maybe a LTSP terminal.

+
+== The Hardware ==
+
+One [http://www.smolts.org/show?UUID=pub_cce01503-8a5d-4960-a755-854d1e98f512 Smolt report]
+is worth thousand words. It's a 233 MHz Geode.
+
+It has
+* Two USB 1.0 ports
+* Speaker and Microphone connectors
+* VGA output
+* 10/100 full duplex Ethernet
+* An SDRAM slot
+* Slot for Compact Flash
+
+== Software ==
+
+=== Bootloader Trouble ===
+
+These Linux 2200 (8363-EXX) models don't have a BIOS.
+I never seen a Windows CE based one, but I suspect the same for it.
+Not that BIOS would be anyhow useful, but there's not LinuxBIOS for these
+machines (due to limitied debugging capabilities; BIOS flash chip soldered
+on board and no serial port) and its firmware is ''horribly'' crappy.
+
+It can load ELF kernel via NFS or TFTP of from Ext2 formatted Compact Flash.
+However it is very... picky. It was intended to load kernel of Red Hat Linux 7,
+which is 2.2 series. It is known to be able to load some 2.4 kernels compiled
+with some ancient GCC, but nothing more than this horribly obsolete stuff.
+Moreover i can't handle zImage nor bzImage. It demand uncompressed {{{vmlinux}}}.
+
+Look 
+[http://www.bluetrait.com/archive/2005/08/07/installing-linux-2200-onto-the-ibm-netvista-n2200-8363/ here]
+for an example of a 2.4 based system running happily
+
+=== Bootloader Solution ===
+
+This can be worked around by using second stage loader
+[http://skosi.org/~lkundrak/misc/nsboot nsboot]. It basically loads as 2.2 kernel
+at {{{0x100000}}} (1M), relocates itself away, does ''something'' and
+uncompresses the kernel image, again at 1M -- this is not configurable and
+have to be taken into account when creating the configuration for kernel build.
+
+Unfortunatelly, it can not obtain the kernel image from network, just from
+Ext2 formated CF. It needs kernel in {{{/nwrlinux/bzImage}}} and initial ram disk
+image in {{{/nwrlinux/initrd}}} -- both have to exist. To boot them you should
+specify the {{{nsboot}}} binary as kernel in the setup utility, you can place
+it on a network server, or on CF as well.
+
+=== Kernel Trouble ===
+
+As I depicted above, stock kernel won't run. Modification to the kernel configuration
+are pretty straightforward; look at the [http://people.redhat.com/lkundrak/netvista/ patches].
+Aside from configuration changes they contain one mor change -- a module for rebooting.
+This may sound funny, but these machines contain no 8042 which is usually connected
+to CPU's reset line -- it uses USB HID devies.
+
+=== Kernel Solution ===
+
+Use custom kernel. It's not that hard to patch the SRPM anyways.
+See http://people.redhat.com/lkundrak/netvista/.
+
+=== Installing Fedora ===
+
+Either install it on a Compact Flash connected to your workstation or use iSCSI root
+and swap (generally a better idea if you have NAS -- extensive writes to a Flash
+media was never a good idea).
+
+See the other blog entry on how to install into an image, this time iSCSI one:
+http://ovecka.be/~lkundrak/blog/entries/fedora-diskless-iscsi.html
+
+Remember to keep {{{/nwrlinux/bzImage}}} and {{{/nwrlinux/initrd}}} up to date
+with your kernel and initrd. Possibly write a script.
