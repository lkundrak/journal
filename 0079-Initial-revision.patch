+Need someone to review your package? 
+
+As my need-to-have-reviewed queue grows, I'm willing to swap
+reviews with you! Just check these out,
+http://preview.tinyurl.com/review-queue most are failry simple,
+pick some and let me know which package you want me to review.
+
+If you've never made a package or newer done a review and
+would like to join maintainers of Fedora package collection,
+this is a good way to start! Do not hesitate to let me know
+if you need any help then!
