+<!-- rss:description -->
+If you've attempted to run {{{crash}}} against live system with recent
+Rawhide kernel that doesn't ship the {{{crash}}} driver, but uses {{{/dev/mem}}}
+to access memory, you've probably failed, getting an error message similar to this:
+
+  crash: read error: kernel virtual address: c0abb600  type: "xtime"
+
+That's because for some unknown reason {{{/dev/mem}}} is limited to first
+256 pages. Until this is fixed [http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/16/117 upstream],
+here's a simple [http://sourceware.org/systemtap/ SystemTap] script that
+tricks the range-checking routine into thinking that our access is not
+beyond the 256-page boundary:
+
+  probe kernel.function("devmem_is_allowed")
+  {
+  	$pagenr = 0;
+  }
+
+It modifies a local variable, so it has to be run in Guru mode:
+
+  [root@bimbo stap]# stap -g devmem.stp 
+
+Voila, {{{crash}}} works.
