+= <!-- rss:title -->Correct use of FORTIFY_SOURCE<!-- /rss:title --> =

+<!-- rss:description -->
+After I found out that Fedora's OpenJDK-based Java is not compiled
+with {{{-fstack-protector}}} or {{{-O2 FORTIFY_SOURCE=2}}} I was thinking
+about automatic way to check whether right{{{%{_optflags}}}} were passed to
+the compiler at the build.
+
+Apart from forgetting to pass {{{%{optflags}}}} upstreams do forget to include
+{{{<stdio.h>}}} and {{{<string.h>}}} when using the potentially dangerous
+string manioulation functions, and then they're not fortified by being replaced
+with macros that utilize argument size checking.
+<!-- /rss:description -->

+
+== How to find out whether FORTIFY_SOURCE was in effect ==
+
+I was thinking to check debuginfo for presence of symbols, but we don't
+use {{{-g3}}} when generatind debuginfo symbols. I've been told the debugging
+symbols would ocuppy too much space as macros are stored expanded; and indeed
+-- it it about 4 times more.
+
+Other idea was to check for {{{__stack_chk_fail}}} symbol. It is invoked
+as a part of {{{stack-protector}}} function prologue when stack canary was
+corrupted, which indicates a stack overflow. But those prologues are not
+generated by all cases -- I think it's only when a character array is
+actually present on stack (not being optimized away). We have a couple of
+very simple programs that would generate false positives.
+
+Another idea was to check if protected functions get replaced by their
+{{{*_chk}}} counterparts. But actually -- most of them don't in cases
+overflows cannot occur.
+
+But at last I was pointed to the fact that {{{*printf}}} should ''always''
+be fortified, as apart from bounds checking they conduct a check whether
+the format string that contains {{{%n}}} format specifier is in read-only
+memory. Fair enough.
+
+Of course this don't spot programs and libraries that don't use {{{*printf}}} functions,
+but at least it doesn't generate false positives. Most C packages contains at leas one
+binary that calls {{{*printf}}}, and test failing for one can indicate that FORTIFY_SOURCE
+is not in effect also for other ones.
+
+Now here's the script:
+* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=437627
+
+== How not to use FORTIFY_SOURCE ==
+
+The script generated a fair amount of positives on my Fedora 8.
+Looking into those I found that most of them fortunatelly weren't cases of
+forgetting to use {{{%{optflags}}}}, but not including {{{<stdio.h>}}} in
+source files what use {{{*printf}}} functions. The same can be the case
+for {{{{mem,str}{cpy,move}}}} functions from {{{<string.h>}}}.
+
+Maintainers, if a check fails for your package, do a {{{make prep}}} and
+try to find the offending source files:
+
+  $ find . -name '*.[ch]' |xargs grep -l printf |xargs grep -L stdio.h
+
+You can also do the same for {{{<string.h>}}} functions. Please patch those,
+and send fixes upstream, so others can benefit. (I've heard rumours that Debian
+is going to use FORTIFY_SOURCE? Or do they currently do?)
+
+Anyways, I'd probably call to the local radio station today and ask them
+to play a song for the one that's going to fix {{{cdrkit}}}. And probably
+also for Joerg Schilling.
