+Bought a new toy lately, a small Atom-based laptop and took an oportiunity
+to experiment with a platform different from what would you expect from
+a Fedora enthusiast. Grabbed a fresh new installation of
+[http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_11.2 OpenSUSE 11.2]
+and gave it a try.
+
+== Hardware ==
+
+The toy looks rather appealing. One can't overlook similarity with another thin
+laptop by a hardware vendor best known for being a notoric winner in the
+vendor-lock in paralympics. Compared to that one, this one is smaller and
+lighter, which is paid for with a rather small battery life (around 2 hours).
+If you ever used a MacBook Air you'd probably be disappointed that unlike Air,
+you can't iron your clothes with Inspiron Mini. For a fraction of price, the
+engineers obviously could not affort putting a fan inside, nor have a reason
+to do so. Wasn't it for the moving-head 1.8" hard drive, there wouldn't be any
+moving parts there. Unfortunatelly, I could not find a model with a solid
+state one.
+
+Upgradability of the machine is virtually none. You can't even replace upgrade
+the humble 1G of RAM memory. You know, the RAM chips never go bad, or do they?
+Dell no longer sells these machines; makes one think if the users didn't
+appreciate not being able to stick in more RAM -- something that can be done
+even with smaller 10" and 9" models.
+The RAM's soldered on the same board with dual-core 1.3 GHz CPU.
+Definitely not a miracle, performance-wise. Apart from three times the
+amount of USB ports of what Air has, you'd be probably surprised to find
+an SD card reader built in. Just for semi-completeness, the display's resolution
+is 1280x800 and there's a VGA port for external display.
+
+You can have a look at the innards here:
+http://ravicblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/dell-mini-12-dissected.html
+
+== Software ==
+
+This is the most poorly supported machine by Linux that I've touched in ages.
+A complete sucker. Which is good, since with a little effort most each piece
+of its hardware is usable.
+
+=== Installing ===
+
+So I copied the Gnome flavour of live OpenSUSE live media to an USB flash memory
+stick and booted it. It booted up a lot faster than I expect it to and what I
+immediately found out was that the display resolution was rather exotic and I
+could not connect to wireless (more about those later). Honestly, the really
+first thought was "wow, the artwork is beautiful." So much for the first
+impression, I rebooted it into installer and started installing. It went pretty
+smoothly, no surprises apart from the disk partitioning.
+
+No idea why is that so hard to get it right, but the partitioner in yast2-based
+installer sucked nearly as much as Debian's one.
+Personally, I like how does Fedora do that, but every other installer I saw
+would do a better job if it just launched {{{fdisk}}}.  No matter how much I tried,
+I could not convince it to use all disk's free space and not just 14G. I ended
+up running an "expert" mode where I could not do anything at all, since the
+device was "busy". "Probably confused by existing partitioning," I thought,
+it contained a NT partition and some service dell stuff. Wiped it away, created
+and empty partition table. This time the installer looked a lot nicer, allowed
+me to create a big partition that spans the whole disk and LVM on it.
+Installation finished. Result? One 14G partition. FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU-, single
+user mode, {{{fdisk}}}, {{{pvresize}}}, {{{lvresize}}}, {{{e2resize}}}...
+
+=== Graphics Blues ===
+
+A lot has been writted about the gigantic suckage the Poulsbo GPU is.
+More-or-less good news is that at http://v3.sk/~lkundrak/psb-opensuse-11.2/
+you can find packages I've ported over from RPM Fusion that can be used.
+Bad news is that the drivers are (who'd think that for a closed blob)
+rather limited. Can't help thinking this must have been a winner of this
+year's hate-your-user competition.
+
+=== Making it Sing ===
+
+Sound not work out of box. Fortunatelly, it worked with sound-2.6 and as I
+later discovered, Takashi Iwai commited a fix just two days ago. This is not
+the first time he was found guilty of commiting exactly the fix I needed.
+He's a SUSE developer as well, therefore I'd expect OpenSUSE stack to be
+generally in a decent state, it was probably just me picking the wrong piece
+of hardware this time. Oh, and here's that fix:
+
+http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound-2.6.git;a=commit;h=1a6969788ef2d5bc3169eee59def6b267182f136
+
+Despite this fix, you get horrible sound dissorts with PulseAudio. As far
+as I'm concerned it's a known bug and being worked on. Not being anything
+that would even remotely resemble anyone thet would be familiar with the
+audio stack, a quick fix for me would be to configure gstreamer to bypass
+Pulse with {{{gstreamer-preferences}}}.
+
+=== Wireless ===
+
+Did not get that to work yet. Broadcom. Not looked into that much, but I'd
+not be surprised if there was a LP PHY. If I'm right, I'm lucky, since some
+time ago I've seen Gábor Stefanik commit some bits that could make it work
+into wireless-testing (though they seem to have been reverted since):
+
+http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Flinville%2Fwireless-testing.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=LP-PHY
+
+In worst case, the MiniPCI-E network adapter is replaceable.
+
+=== Software Load ===
+
+As I've said, I've chosen the GNOME flavour (Most OpenSUSE users seem to prefer
+KDE). The distro feels very polished, from the bootup procedure to the Desktop
+itself. They replaced the GNOME menu with their own version, and I'd say it
+could use some improvement (found it hard to launch terminal :). It does only offer
+a couple of most used applications, it uses a separate dialog to find
+and run some other application. You can't search the application from the menu.
+Probably needless to add, this is just a matter of taste, not a technical barier.
+The standard GNOME menu is offered as Panel applet, you can replace the OpenSUSE
+menu with it, or even use both if you like.
+
+When it comes to applications, OpenSUSE tends to use Mono-base tools. Looking both
+at the performance and the memory consumption I couldn't help thinking it feels
+pre-production. Having said the machine has humble techincal parameters one can't
+blame me for not using Tomboy, Banshee or F-Spot. (Tried to actually use the
+latter and would definitely advise my friends to do so. If not memory and CPU,
+I could probably at least use more battery life.)
+
+For package management a tool called {{{zypper}}} is used. With command-line interface
+similar to {{{yum}}} it's rather easy to grasp. I appreciated that it searches rather
+quickly compared to {{{yum}}}, didn't care much enough to research why. The repositories
+can be added and removed without editing the configuration file. A nice detail, but
+OpenSUSE seems to rely on custom repositories heavily so it's rather
+important there. What I did not like is that it by default refreshes the repository
+metadata on each run and installs packages right after downloading. The latter may
+be an advantage if you are disk-space constrained, though it might have been nice
+if they parallelized it (not that {{{yum}}} would do that).
+
+What's unhappy is how OpenSUSE decentralizes repositories. It might be useful
+in some specific use-cases, but think of the poor user who just wants to install a
+package... I needed Rhythmbox. Took me some time to learn about Contrib repository
+(shame on me for not reading documentation). Why on earth isn't it present by default?
+It could be disabled or something. Needed another package ({{{synergy}}}), not present
+in contrib, but managed to find it in someone's collection (or how is it called)
+in Build Service. I wish I could just {{{zypper in synergy}}}.
+
+Time to get some real work done. What I do for Fedora is package development; why
+not package stuff I needed? Started with {{{psb}}} kernel module. What I need to note
+now, this is the time I encountered the first bug (with {{{git config color.ui}}}
+set to {{{auto}}}, the pager didn't let the escape sequences pass through like
+{{{less -R}}} does). Everything else worked flawlessly so far, I'm not used to
+that :) Another thing worth noting is that anyone who drives the
+[http://en.opensuse.org/Kernel_Module_Packages kernel module packaging]
+infrastructure for OpenSUSE did not do a proper research, otherwise he could have
+delivered [http://rpmfusion.org/Packaging/KernelModules/Kmods2 more for smaller price
+resuing what's already been done].
+
+This is where I started to think that OpenSUSE must just hate packagers. Having
+my tiny RPM done, I had no way to ensure it's buildable reproducibly (its
+BuildRequires are correct). Fedora engineers are familiar with {{{mock}}} tool -- for
+OpenSUSE I was told that I need a Build Service account. For a local build.
+And I need a "Build Service checkout" to build from. If a Novell engineer happens
+to read this, surprised why you have so little community contributors? They
+don't feel welcome. They feel that your tooling is a medieval torture device.
+
+Overally -- not bad. I'm going to use this for my desktop work and will attempt
+to do some Fedora development from it ;)
