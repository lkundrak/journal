+...whe just don't want Roma, foreigners and people of different
+races to be our neighbors! Religion does not matter, as long as
+it's no Muslim or Jew. And we want no homosexuals. We probably
+don't want you to be our neighbor, especially if you have a health
+trouble that would qualify you as disabled.

+This is the result of [http://www.sme.sk/c/4247836/predsudky-voci-romom-ci-moslimom-sa-vraj-prehlbuju.html

+What I find interesting is the ''far right'' line in the chart, how

+Given [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_National_Party SNS],
+a party that would easily be banned in other countries for being supportive
+of racial and ethnical hatred while openly sympathizing with World Word II
+pro-fascist government is them most infuential political party in Slovakia,
+this doesn't seems to be just an attitude of small amount of people that
+would qualify as ''extremists'', but rather a natoin-wide attitude.
+
+So for now, I'll refrain from going back to that country, and advise
+you to think twice before going there.
