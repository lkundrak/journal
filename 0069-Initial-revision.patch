+
+<!-- rss:description -->
+* The buildings tend to be rather small, smaller density, leaving quite some space for trees
+* Very friendly people
+* If you like beer, visit Czech instead
+* Quite good public transportation, S-Bahn train lines running through the city
+* Berliners like to ride bikes a lot! You'll see bikes around everywhere
+* Pedestrian crossing are not marged with full white stripes when there are traffic lights
+* Their ticket machines are overengineered :)
